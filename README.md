# Women in STEM: Global EDA Project

## Overview
This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of female participation in STEM fields across 6 countries (USA, Canada, Australia, China, India, Germany).

## Key Findings
- **Retention Gap:** There is a significant ~7% drop-off between female enrollment and graduation rates in STEM.
- **Support Over Numbers:** Low correlation between enrollment and graduation suggests that university support systems are more critical for success than initial recruitment.
- **Geographical Leaders:** North American nations lead in female representation in this dataset.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repo.
2. Ensure you have the `women_in_stem.csv` file in the same folder.
3. Install dependencies: `pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn`
4. Run `Women_In_Stem_EDA.ipynb` in your Jupyter environment.
